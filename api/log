    GEN: Socket Server Refactor
    
    I had a misunderstanding as to how the internal client of the Thruway
    socket server works. Instead of a separate client for each channel
    there is only one internal client which must deal with deciding
    which channel to send it on.
    
    So there is now one client in /services/socketserver and I have
    refactored the folder structure in .routes to be simpler and have only
    one  directory level in sockets. This now just contains the classes for
    sending messages to the internal client.
    
    A lot simpler overall now that I understand it.
